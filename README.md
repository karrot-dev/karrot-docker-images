**This repo is now deprecated**

Docker images are now built directly from the frontend and backend repos:
- https://codeberg.org/karrot/karrot-frontend
- https://codeberg.org/karrot/karrot-backend

They end up in the packages section:
- https://codeberg.org/karrot/-/packages/container/karrot-frontend
- https://codeberg.org/karrot/-/packages/container/karrot-backend

Releases are over at https://codeberg.org/karrot/karrot/releases
